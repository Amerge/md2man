makes the 
.BR markdown (7) 
file format friendly for writing UNIX manual
pages by extending its syntax, semantics, and assumed processing extensions.
.SS Syntax

  paragraph.

.SS Semantics
.PP
md2man extends 
.BR markdown (7) 
semantics by treating top\-level headings specially.
.SS Top\-level headings
.PP
The first top\-level heading (H1) found in the input is considered to be the
\fB\fC.TH\fR directive in 
.BR roff (7), 
which defines the UNIX manual page's header and
footer.  Any subsequent top\-level headings are treated as second\-level (H2).
.SS Extensions
.PP
md2man enables the following Redcarpet

.BR markdown (7):
